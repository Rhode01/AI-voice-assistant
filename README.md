### AI-voice-assistant
This project is a voice assistant built using the BlenderBot model for conversation generation and the Whisper model for speech detection. The user interacts with the assistant through a Gradio interface for audio input.
### Prerequisites
```bash
    Python version 3.8 and above
```
### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rhode01/fi.git AI-Voice-assistant
cd AI-Voice-assistant
```
### Creating Virtual Env
```bash
python -m venv myvenv
```
### installing dependencies
Use the following command to install the required packages specified in the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install > requirements.txt
```
### Starting the server
To run the AI voice assistant, start a Jupyter notebook server:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Once the server is running, navigate to the appropriate notebook and execute it to begin using the voice assistant.
### Additional Information
BlenderBot Model: The BlenderBot model is a conversational AI model developed by Facebook AI. It is trained to engage in natural and open-ended conversations with users.
Whisper Model: The Whisper model is used for speech detection. It enables the AI voice assistant to understand spoken input from users.
Gradio Interface: Gradio is a user-friendly interface for creating customizable UI components for machine learning models. In this project, it provides the interface for audio input to the voice assistant.
